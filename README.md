# swipeGame

This is the prototype for a game idea we had during Local Hack Day 2016.

The original idea of the game was to simulate the rush and excitement of chaining attacks...but in the air. The idea is that as enemies fall down from the top, you dash from one enemy to the other chaining your attacks and trying to go as high up as you can.

The current implementation you see above was made in less than 10 hours.
